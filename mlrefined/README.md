# Machine Learning Refined Jupyter notebooks 

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python files associated with [the Machine Learning Refined blog](https://jermwatt.github.io/mlrefined/index.html), a set of supplementary resources for the textbook Machine Learning Refined (Cambridge University Press). Visit [http://www.mlrefined.com](http://www.mlrefined.com) for free chapter downloads and tutorials, and [our Amazon site for details regarding a hard copy of the text](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Refined-Foundations-Applications/dp/1107123526/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471025359&sr=8-1&keywords=machine+learning+refined).

Python 3 and a number of standard Python packages for scientific computing (numpy, matplotlib, and Jupyter being the most common) are required to use the notebooks in this repo, as well as a [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/).  To get these basic libraries we highly recommend downloading the [Anaconda Python 3 distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).

Many of these notebooks also require the Automatic Differentiator [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) which can be installed by typing the following command at your terminal
      
      pip install autograd

Note: to pull a minimial sized clone of this repo (including only the most recent commit) use a shallow pull as follows
